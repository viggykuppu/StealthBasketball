Stealth Basketball is an absurd misuse of basketball terms and concepts in a Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell-styled top-down stealth game.

Fun Concepts to try to abuse:
	Point Guard
	Chaos Dunk
	Travel
	3-point and free throw lines

Action Grid Based:
	Grid singleton allows units to be spawned and moved on the grid, and can respond to queries about what is in a given space, and manage the timer/turn system.
	Grid calls a GridUpdate() function on all components (which are presumably GridSprite types) 
	Sprites can get the current status of the turn (50% through) and their previous and target positions for the turn, so they can then tween appropriately.
	Player moves any time during the turn, once per turn. Guards and world react at the turn barrier, and the game may require the player to throw early in the turn to 		not get dodged, for instance.

Sound:
	All actions make some amount of sound, represented as a circular guard alert creator. Dribbling is less than dunking, for instance.
	Sound circular radius randomized to some extent

Guard AI:
	Guard alertness and general movement patterns currently unestablished. Guards move after the player.

Possible player actions:
	4-directional movement
	4-directional 2-turn dunk effect
	4-directional ball throw (maybe attacks the closest guard in a 90-degree angle area)
	Movement without dribbling (toggled) might protect the ball, or prevent sound, but counts as a travel--possibly tied to a ref following the player.
	Shoot on the net! Guards can try to block the ball.
	Hit switches! Change the maze

Visuals:
	Black-outlined high-res photos, black outlined from a green screen
	Ball has some kind of tween function to make it arc to places
	Guards probably have a 4-frame fall animation and then flash nes-style, shoot black dots tweened to the right place
	Fuckin tweens loitering on my property

UNRESTRICTED MOVEMENT?
BALL PORTALS
	-Throw the ball through before you move through (one-directional portal)
